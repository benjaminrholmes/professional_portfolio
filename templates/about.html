                <p><span class="image left"><img src="/static/images/head_shot.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>I recently graduated from the University of Suffolk with a first-class honour studying a Bachelor of Science degree in Nutrition and Human Health and I am currently awaiting my results from a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics at Queen Mary University of London. I am looking to fill a position within data science where I can continue to develop my skills in statistical analysis, data mining, machine learning and software development.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate degree, I found myself attracted to the research and data analysis aspects more so than practising as a nutritionist. After I graduated I decided to take this interest further by studying for a masters degree in bioinformatics and during this time, I took a particular interest in the programming focused modules, such as Coding for Scientists - which was a module dedicated to learning Python. I found it extremely rewarding and enjoyable and I managed to achieve 90% in the final Python exam. There was also a software development group project where I and four other students were tasked to create a web application using Python within a Flask framework. The brief required us to develop an application that allows the user to explore information on human transcription factors and their target genes. I found the experience enormously beneficial to learning new concepts specific to web development as I was assigned to primarily develop the frontend and the front to back-end integration. I gained a foundation in using javascript, CSS, bootstrap and SQL which I have since applied to my own software project which will allow researchers to conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses in a continuous workflow. I was also assigned as the project manager and found working with a team of people whilst managing the project invaluable to my professional development.</p>
                <p>The dissertation during my master’s degree titled: Using machine learning to predict thyroid disease and multimorbidity was conducted entirely within a Python environment. This project compared three different machine learning algorithms on five different datasets, I found the experience I gained during this project so valuable for remaining organised and systematic when handling and exploring large and diverse datasets. I also found it immensely beneficial for discovering various machine learning workflows using multiple algorithms and pre-processing techniques. I have applied the experience I gained at university to a number of research projects outside of education, one of which investigated the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes using UKBiobank data. I was responsible for the entire project from designing the study, data cleaning and pre-processing, choosing, and running the analyses using R and then writing the manuscript for publication - which is still ongoing, with a plan to publish later in the year. I have taken an interest in further developing the skills I have learnt thus far within my free time as well, such as working through some of the machine learning competitions on Kaggle or using DataCamp’s courses to build upon or learn new concepts in data science. Recently as a hobby, I have also experimented using data visualisation using Python and R to highlight football player and team statistics.</p>
